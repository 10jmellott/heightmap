   Program: Heightmap
```

##description##
```
This program is intended to use basic OpenGL utilities and libraries to achieve
a surface mesh in which height is determined by pixel values. OpenGL is to be
used to render this mesh within a skybox.
```

##progress##
```
Skybox contains correct textures and will only shift with rotations.

Skybox still needs more depth, as the range is only 2 deep.
